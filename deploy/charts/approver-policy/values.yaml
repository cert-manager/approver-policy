# Deployment update strategy for the approver-policy Deployment.
#
# This could be needed when deploying approver-policy on each control-plane node
# and setting anti-affinities to forbid two pods on the same node. In this
# situation, default values of maxSurge (25% round up to next integer = 1) and
# maxUnavailable (25% round down to next integer = 0) block the rolling update
# as the new surge pod can't be scheduled on a control-plane node due to
# anti-affinities. Setting maxSurge to 0 and maxUnavailable to 1 would solve the
# problem.

#  strategy:
#    type: RollingUpdate
